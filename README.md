# AnsrCoach-NGO-Website-project
I developed this dynamic NGO website for my AnsrCoach Web Development internship project. Download the zip file, unzip it & just copy and paste the folder inside it in the 'htdocs' folder inside the XAMPP directory. Run the XAMPP server and import the MySQL database file from this folder &amp; you are good to go.
